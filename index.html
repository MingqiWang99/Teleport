                Only the warm light of the restaurant flickered faintly<br>
                Call comes one after another<br>
                “Is the decision we made right?”<br>
                I don't know if it should be like this<br>
                At least having one farewell ceremony<br>
                “Should I go back?”<br>
                “I do not know.”<br>
                Curled up on the sofa<br>
                Stared into space<br>
                Panted<br>
                I don’t know how many times I have walked along this road<br>
                Hustle days have not stopped<br>
                All the time, separation <br>

                Not just people<br>
                But the memories of every day in the past<br>
                With traces of living<br>
                Can't make a decision<br>
                Inner desire and decision are always different<br>
                Is it really so difficult to do things against your will?<br>
                The book, painting materials, mallet, wooden plate, are lying in the box<br>
                Taking a long nap<br>
                Don't know when can they wake up<br>
                But each separation, a lot of things are discarded and forgotten <br>

                  Sold out<br>
                  Polypropylene, Non-woven leak prof fabric and dusty package<br>
                  In the first month of the year, nowhere to find<br>
                  Anxious<br>
                  Night falls, empty station, hope fades away<br>
                  From south to north, the sun is shining and the sun is setting<br>
                  "It doesn't matter, it's good here"<br>
                  More than a dozen boxes packed in giant cardboard boxes<br>
                  Friction between the crisp sound of the paper shell being torn and the plastic packaging<br>
                  They are going to a place far away<br>
                  Recipient, phone number, address<br>

                  Across the ocean, over the mountains<br>
                  Always hope to use magic to teleport things where they should go<br>
                  But there is no magic in this world<br>
                  Has that box traveled safely to another continent?<br>
                  One week<br>

                  This year is always unsettling<br>
                  Too many distracting thoughts in the brain<br>

                  Some people are far away but always live by the side<br>
